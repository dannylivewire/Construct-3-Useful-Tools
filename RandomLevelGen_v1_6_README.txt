Included are two versions of the demo project:

1.
The NEW version utilized hierarchies and a new Construct feature - object templates.
This allows to move all scenes to a separate storage layout and spawn them by template name. 
The code in this version has also been reworked and optimized.

Please use Construct release 290 or later to open this version:

2.
The OLD version requires all scenes to be on the main game layout, which is a bit messy. 
This approach may be used however in games where each level has its own set of scenes, or when using objects which don't support hierarchies (like tilemaps or form controls)
